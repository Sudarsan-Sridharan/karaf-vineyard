# Apache Karaf Vineyard

[Apache Karaf Vineyard](http://karaf.apache.org/vineyard) is a full featured platform to manage and define services and
API in your ecosystem.

## Overview

Karaf Vineyard is composed by three main modules:

* Karaf Vineyard Registry is where the services and API are stored. It's where you can describe the services and add
metadata. Based on this metadata, you can define additional policies (security, workflow, update, ...).
Karaf Vineyard Registry UI provides convenient way to enhance the service description, see the impact map (which services
use which other services), and interact with other Vineyard modules.
* Karaf Vineyard Gateway is a service gateway. Other applications and services in your ecosystem will only use
the Vineyard Gateway to use the actual underlying services. Karaf Vineyard Gateway faÃ§ade the services and proxy
to the backend services. It can also do extra data format transformation, protocol transformation, implement
additional policies (as security for instance). Vineyard Gateway can interact with the Vineyard Registry to
retrieve and expose services, including the required transformations. Gateway also provides some convenient
endpoint plugins (for Apache Camel, Apache CXF, Apache Beam, Apache Tika, ...) to be able to directly and
easily use the Vineyard Gateway in client applications (the client applications don't use the actual service
directly anymore, they use the service exposed in Vineyard Gateway).
* Karaf Vineyard Discovery is a set of plugins that can be executed (for instance by the Vineyard Registry) to
automatically discover services on your on premise ecosystem, but also on your cloud ecosystem. The goal is to avoid
a long process of services description (most of the time made by hand) and be able to detect unexpected services
creation.

Each module can be use independently. However, using all modules all together gives you all features and a
powerful platform.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Karaf Vinyard is available as a Karaf features repository (and also Karaf KAR file and profile).
You can directly install Karaf Vineyard modules in a running Karaf instance using the corresponding Vineyard
features:

* karaf-vineyard-registry
* karaf-vineyard-gateway
* karaf-vineyard_discovery

Simply register Karaf Vineyard features repository:

```
karaf@root()> feature:repo-add mvn:org.apache.karaf.vineyard/apache-karaf-vineyard/4.0.0/xml/features
```

Then you can directly install the Karaf Vineyard features using `feature:install` command.

### Building

In order to build Karaf Vineyard, you need the following requirements:

* JDK 1.8.x or above
* Apache Maven 3.x

For instance, on a Linux Ubuntu system, it can be installed with:

```
apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk maven
```

Then, you can clone the Karaf Vineyard git repository using:

```
git clone https://github.com/jbonofre/karaf-vineyard
```

To build Karaf Vineyard, you do:

```
mvn clean install
```

NB: you can bypass the tests to have a faster build using

```
mvn clean install -DskipTests
```
