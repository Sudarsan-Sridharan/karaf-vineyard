# Apache Karaf Vineyard

[Apache Karaf Vineyard](http://karaf.apache.org/vineyard) is a full featured platform to manage and define services and
API in your ecosystem.

## Overview

Karaf Vineyard is composed by three main modules:

* Karaf Vineyard Registry is where the services and API definitions are stored. It's where you can describe the API,
 including resources, policies, metadata. The registry can be manipulated by a REST API.
* Karaf Vineyard Gateway is the API gateway. Other applications and services in your ecosystem will only use
 the Vineyard Gateway to use the actual underlying services and API. Karaf Vineyard Gateway faÃ§ade the services and proxy
 to the concrete backend services. Vineyard Gateway can interact with the Vineyard Registry to
 retrieve and expose API.
* Karaf Vineyard Importers is a set of plugins that you can execute to import existing services present in your
ecosystem, creating the corresponding entry in the registry and exposing them in the gateway.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Karaf Vinyard is available as a Karaf features repository (and also Karaf KAR file and profile).
You can directly install Karaf Vineyard modules in a running Karaf instance using the corresponding Vineyard
features:

* karaf-vineyard-registry
* karaf-vineyard-gateway
* karaf-vineyard-importer

Simply register Karaf Vineyard features repository:

```
karaf@root()> feature:repo-add mvn:org.apache.karaf.vineyard/apache-karaf-vineyard/1.0.0-SNAPSHOT/xml/features
```

Then you can directly install the Karaf Vineyard features using `feature:install` command.

### Building

In order to build Karaf Vineyard, you need the following requirements:

* JDK 1.8.x or above
